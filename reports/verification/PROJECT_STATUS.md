# SepsisGuard-UAR progress — 2026-10-21

## Completed and observed locally

- Repository imported into local Git; implementation and execution history retained.
- Downloaded official v1.0.0 PhysioNet 2019 A/B data via anonymous S3.
- A=20,336; B=20,000; 1,552,210 hourly rows. Sepsis-labeled patients: 2,932 (7.27%); positive hours: 27,916 (1.80%).
- Full schema, label, time-continuity, manifest/data and exact-byte-duplicate audit passed. Zero exact duplicate files. Subject linkage beyond the published file IDs cannot be ruled out by this audit.
- Deterministic patient splits: A train 14,235, validation 3,050, calibration 3,051; B test 20,000. All B exclusively test_B.
- Original validation: 23 tests passed, including future-value mutation, held-out-file deletion, independent train-statistic calculations, patient-boundary resets, original endpoint labels, and deterministic DataLoader ordering.
- Week 2 fitted on 552,665 A/train rows only. Retained 39 predictors (EtCO2 entirely unobserved in A/train). Windows: train 552,665, validation 118,499, calibration 119,051. Verified 128 spread-out windows per development split plus deterministic batches of shape 8 x 12 x 78. B not opened for fitting or window checks.
- Both notebook Python-cell sequences completed using the explicitly identified in-process local fallback. This host denied Jupyter kernel sockets; neither a local Jupyter session nor a Colab result is being claimed for these executions.
- Local validation source commit: 28f1aef005338af437ea565660213aed83b0ac66. Later source changes add first-run source-ZIP upload and this documentation.

## Import verification (2026-10-21)

- Updated code passes 25 local tests, including fresh-subprocess Colab detection checks.
- Notebook code cells pass syntax validation.
- A CPU-only GitHub Actions workflow runs the synthetic and leakage regression tests.

## Cloud and version-control status

- Source import completed on 2026-10-21: commit 4755ee5c26f231e0520808ae34b3fedcb3fe9d9d, 47 project files. Remote tree inspection found no protected patient-level files.
- GitHub Actions run 39648233169 succeeded: 25 tests passed in 42.99 seconds on the CPU runner.
- The updated Week 1 notebook opened from GitHub in the connected local browser. Browser control then failed with Cannot attach to this target; no new Colab execution or Drive write was performed. The notebook remains open for continuation.
- Canonical repository: https://github.com/shakiful/Sepsisguard-Uar, supplied by the user on 2026-10-21. The repository is public. Source, tests, notebooks, and aggregate verification reports are suitable for this remote; protected derivatives remain private.
- The original 2026-10-18 CPU Colab attempt did not complete the data pipeline or confirm Drive report persistence. Its old imported notebook is not evidence of successful cloud computation.
- Both notebooks now clone the canonical GitHub repository directly, record its actual commit, and save milestones to private Drive. A starter ZIP upload is no longer required.
- A compute-reporting bug was corrected so a fresh Colab subprocess can be identified before importing google.colab.
- No dataset archive, report, split manifest, or model checkpoint has yet been verified saved to Drive. No predictive model or GPU training run is claimed.

## Continue from this checkpoint

1. Open notebooks/01_week1_colab.ipynb in Colab from the repository. Select CPU, run the first cell, and authorize private Drive mounting when prompted.
2. Run the Week 1 pipeline and compare the cohort audit and counts with the measured local results above.
3. Complete notebooks/02_week2_colab.ipynb using the exact saved Week 1 manifest. On a reset, set WEEK1_RUN_ID to the completed run. Dataset fingerprints must match before fitting.
4. Verify private Drive milestone files and update this status with actual cloud observations. Keep the fitted state, patient manifest, and per-file hashes out of Git.
5. Later train and compare the planned baselines on A only, calibrate independently, and unlock B only for frozen final evaluation.

## Deliverables

The source ZIP contains shareable source, two Colab notebooks, tests, aggregate verification reports, and a Git history bundle. A separate private checkpoint ZIP contains protected patient summaries, split manifest, per-file hashes, fitted preprocessing state, notebook execution outputs, environment snapshots, and logs. It excludes raw patient files. Original data can be downloaded again from the documented official S3 mirror.

No model training or clinical validation has been performed. No Colab GPU compute was requested.
